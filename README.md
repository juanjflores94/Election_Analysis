The total amount of votes that were cased in the congressional election was 369,711. Denver received the most votes in this election, winning 82.8% of the total votes. Jefferson won 10.5% of the total votes, whereas Arapahoe only won 6.7% of the total votes.

As for the candidates, Diana DeGette received the most votes, which was 73.8% of all votes or 272,892 votes. The second place candidate, Charles Casper Stockham, received 23% of the total votes. Finally, the third candidate, Raymon Anthony Doane, only received 3.1% of the overall votes.

## Summary
This code can be changed to find the most number of voters with different filters. If the data included other characteristics, such as demographics and geography, the code can be changed to include these characteristics and the analysis can be broken down even further.

This code can also be modified to determine patterns among the characteristics. We could test the percentage of voters by county against each candidate.
